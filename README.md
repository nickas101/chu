# Introduction 
This repo is for keeping track of Dorsum solver in the static oven code things.
# Getting Started
1. Learn python.
2. Have a look at Alexey's awesome diagram.
# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

- Testing - Use pytest, it's awesome!
- To build it you need a python interpreter
- See requirements.txt for python environment requirements
- There are approvers required for pull requests. Still testing this works.
 * pip install -r requirements.txt to get the right stuff
 * pip freeze > requirements.txt to save it all.
